<h3 align="center">Snake Game </h3>

  <p align="center">
     Snake Game is a classic arcade-style game where you control a snake to collect food and avoid collisions with walls and itself. I used Python and the Pygame library to build it, including features like scoring, graphics, and a game over screen. Players control the snake with arrow keys, aim to eat food, and try to achieve the highest score without crashing. It's a fun and nostalgic game project showcasing Python game development.

## About The Project



Here's a video demonstrating the Snake Game Simulator in action:

</p>




This Python-based Snake Game project, utilizing Turtle graphics, offers a lively implementation of a classic arcade game. In the game, the snake grows as it consumes food, and its score is visually tracked after each meal. Moreover, one of the project's unique features allows players to store their highest scores in memory. This feature is visually emphasized using Turtle graphics, satisfying the competitive spirit of players and aiding them in monitoring and improving their performance. The game provides a fun and educational example of Python game development while reviving the timeless appeal of the classic Snake Game.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Python Installation: Make sure you have the latest Python version installed for project development.
- [ ] Project Setup: Set up your project environment, and consider using a development platform like Replit for ease of development.
- [ ] Core Game Mechanics: Begin by implementing the core mechanics of the Snake Game, including snake movement, food generation, and collision controls.
- [ ] Graphics Enhancements: Use Turtle graphics to improve the appearance of the snake and food, making the game visually appealing.
- [ ] Scoring System: Create a scoring system that allows players to track their scores and record the highest score.
- [ ] Game Over Screen: Add a "Game Over" screen that informs players when the snake collides with walls or itself and provides an option to restart.
- [ ] Advanced Features: Consider adding new and more complex features to the game, such as increasing the snake's speed or introducing special abilities.
- [ ] Testing and Debugging: Ensure the game runs smoothly by adding tests and addressing any issues or bugs.
- [ ] Documentation: Create a user guide or documentation that explains how to play the game and its features.

This roadmap provides a step-by-step plan for the development of your Snake Game project, covering everything from initial setup to advanced gameplay features.
